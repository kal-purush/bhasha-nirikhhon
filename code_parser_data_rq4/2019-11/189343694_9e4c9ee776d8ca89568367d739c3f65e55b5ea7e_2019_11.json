Run step 3 to recreate head3.lst\n    energies.py refresh\n\n3. Run partial conformers. conformer 1 to 100\n    energies.py conf 1, 100\n\nAssuming the underlying c code will:\n1. Write only opp files that are calculated (so that multi-threads won't overwrite each other). Dummies and\nun-calculated conformers don't have an opp file.\n2. When write opp file, no previous run is loaded.\n3. A separate procedure will read all opp files and compose head3.lst at the end.\n\"\"\""
