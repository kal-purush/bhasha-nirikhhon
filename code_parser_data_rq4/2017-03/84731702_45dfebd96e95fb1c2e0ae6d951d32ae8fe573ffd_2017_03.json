        "* @author Elliott Bolzan\n *\n *         This class represents a View in the program. Specific kinds of views\n *         can extend this class, like CollapsibleView. Every View must have a\n *         title.\n * \n *         This code's purpose: providing a base GUI class for all views in the\n *         project.\n * \n *         Why I think this code is well designed: this code is as minimal as it\n *         should be. A View, in our project, is characterized by the fact it\n *         has a title and by the fact it can have subcomponents. This class\n *         provides this capability without providing any extra bells and\n *         whistles.\n *",
