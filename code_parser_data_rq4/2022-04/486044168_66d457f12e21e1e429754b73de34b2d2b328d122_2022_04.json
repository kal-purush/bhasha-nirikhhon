        "GR: If you were in the middle of running to the enemy to fight and cancelled, then the actual movement is also cancelled so you don't carry on running to the enemy.",
        "GR: Just a safeguard to ensure that the trigger is \"fresh\" the next time you attack something, and not possibly not consumed yet by the Animator Controller.",
