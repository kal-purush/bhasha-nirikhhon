        "* TSickle generally does not support parameterized type aliases, because\n * JSCompiler does not support them either, and emits `?`. However TSickle\n * special cases `NonNullable<A>` to emit just `A`, so that the compiler does\n * not back off optimizations for properties accessed on the `?` type.\n * The main drawback is that to JS code the return type of this function still\n * appears to contain null or undefined. This causes some inconvenience, but\n * on balance is better than the optimization backoff and loss of type safety\n * caused by `?`."
