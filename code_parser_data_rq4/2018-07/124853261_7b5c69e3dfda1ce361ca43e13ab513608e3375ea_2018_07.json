The pattern followed to avoid\n  surprises is forcing users to declare which features to ignore (even\n  if they are not supported).\n\n  Note that this function creates a ModuleSpec that when exported exports a\n  Module (based on a modified copy of the original SavedModel) and not a\n  SavedModel.\n\n  Args:\n    saved_model_path: Directory with the SavedModel to use.\n    drop_collections: Additionally list of collection to drop.\n\n  Returns:\n    A ModuleSpec.\n  \"\"\""
