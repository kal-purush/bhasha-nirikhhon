If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.\nNote that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.\n\n'''"
