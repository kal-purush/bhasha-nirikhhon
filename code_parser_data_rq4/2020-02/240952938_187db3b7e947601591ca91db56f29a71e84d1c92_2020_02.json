        "'''\nLoading and viewing your data\n\nIn this chapter, you're going to look at a subset of the Department of Buildings Job Application\nFilings dataset from the NYC Open Data portal. This dataset consists of job applications filed on\nJanuary 22, 2017.\n\nYour first task is to load this dataset into a DataFrame and then inspect it using the .head()\nand .tail()\nmethods. However, you'll find out very quickly that the printed results don't allow you to see\neverything you need, since there are too many columns. Therefore, you need to look at the data\nin another way.\n\nThe .shape and .columns attributes let you see the shape of the DataFrame and obtain a list of\nits columns. From here, you can see which columns are relevant to the questions you'd like to ask\nof the data. To this end, a new DataFrame, df_subset, consisting only of these relevant columns,\nhas been pre-loaded. This is the DataFrame you'll work with in the rest of the chapter.\n\nGet acquainted with the dataset now by exploring it with pandas! This initial exploratory analysis\nis a crucial first step of data cleaning.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n50XP\nImport pandas as pd.\n-Read 'dob_job_application_filings_subset.csv' into a DataFrame called df.\n-Print the head and tail of df.\n-Print the shape of df and its columns. Note: .shape and .columns are attributes, not methods,\nso you don't need to follow these with parentheses ().\n-Hit 'Submit Answer' to view the results! Notice the suspicious number of 0 values. Perhaps these\nrepresent missing data.\n'''"
