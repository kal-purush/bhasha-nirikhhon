        "YOUR 3 CHALLENGES\nChange the game to follow these rules:\n\n1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. (Hint: Always save the previous dice roll in a separate variable)\n2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100. (Hint: you can read that value with the .value property in JavaScript. This is a good oportunity to use google to figure this out :)\n3. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. (Hint: you will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS code for the first one.)",
