        "* This class is part of the \"World of Zuul\" application. \n * \"World of Zuul\" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  \n *\n * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.\n * A command currently consists of two strings: a command word and a second\n * word (for example, if the command was \"take map\", then the two strings\n * obviously are \"take\" and \"map\").\n * \n * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid\n * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not\n * known) then the command word is <null>.\n *\n * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.\n * \n * @author  Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes\n * @version 2011.07.31",
