        "* The internal symmetry detection can be divided into two types: \n * CLOSED: includes the circular and dihedral symmetries, and\n * NON_CLOSED: includes the helical and protein repeats symmetries.\n * All internal symmetry cases share one property: all the subunits have the same 3D transformation.\n * \n * A possible automatic way to discrimine between the two types is that the closed symmetry generates\n * CeSymm alignments with circular permutations (2 blocks in AFPChain), whereas the non-closed symmetry\n * generates alignments without a CP (only one block in AFPChain).\n * \n * @author Aleix Lafita\n *"
