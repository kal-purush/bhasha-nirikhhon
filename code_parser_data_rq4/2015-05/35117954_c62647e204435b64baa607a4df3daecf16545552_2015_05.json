        "* Puzzle #1: Birthday\n *\n * I came up with this puzzle as I was preparing material to use for interviewing new graduates. I didn't think that it\n * was a hard problem, but surprisingly 70% of the people I interviewed couldn't come up with an answer at all, so to\n * see if it was a fluke, I showed it to my coworkers. My colleagues solved it, but not as quickly as I thought they\n * would, and trying to solve the problem became a bit of a sensation for a couple days.\n *\n * The included method is simple - given a birthday, the method should return the age (in years) of a person born on\n * that day. The method could conceivably be used as:\n *    System.out.println(\"The user is \" + computeAge(user.getBirthday()) + \" years old.\");\n *\n * Sometimes the method returns the correct age, sometimes it doesn't. Good luck!"
