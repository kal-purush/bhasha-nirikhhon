        "* TestAPI\n *\n *  # Introduction   Welcome to the reference for my API!   <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST_API\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">REST</a> is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON technology.   My REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:  * Enable x.  * Support y.  * Process z.   ## Endpoints   My API is provided via the following endpoints.   | Tenant                 | Base URL for REST Endpoints    |  |- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -|- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -|  | Production             | https://api.mydomain.com/v1    |  | API Sandbox            | https://sandbox.mydomain.com/v1|     The production endpoint provides access to your live user data. The API Sandbox tenant is a good place to test your code without affecting real-world data. To use it, you must be provisioned with an API Sandbox tenant.   ## Access to the API   If you have a tenant, you already have access to the API.   If you don't have a tenant, go to <a href=\\\"https://www.mydomain.com/resource/sandbox\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.mydomain.com/resource/sandbox</a> and sign up for a one. # Operations:  ## Basic Info  These are the basic operations for my API...   etc \n *\n * OpenAPI spec version: 1.0.0\n * Contact: support@swaggerhub.com\n * Generated by: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.",
