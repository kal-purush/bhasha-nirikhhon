        "* This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.\n * A command currently consists of two parts: a CommandWord and a string\n * (for example, if the command was \"take map\", then the two parts\n * are TAKE and \"map\").\n *\n * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid\n * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not\n * known) then the CommandWord is UNKNOWN.\n *\n * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.",
        "* Create a command object. First and second words must be supplied, but\n     * the second may be null.\n     * @param commandWord The CommandWord. UNKNOWN if the command word\n     *                  was not recognised.\n     * @param secondWord The second word of the command. May be null.",
