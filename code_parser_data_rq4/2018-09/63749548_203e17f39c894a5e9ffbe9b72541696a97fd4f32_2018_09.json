        "* Pax Exam test wrapper which starts (and stops) an etcd test server via\n * launcher. We need to do this because jetcd-launcher uses Testcontainers,\n * which cannot run inside OSGi (due to the use of TCL loadClass(String) in\n * DockerClientProviderStrategy). And even if we were to use the launcher only\n * in the config() method (which \"is executed before the OSGi container is\n * launched, so it does run in plain Java\"), the Pax Exam probe still needs to\n * load the entire test class and all of its references (launcher with\n * Testcontainers) into OSGi, which is a PITA. There is also no easy way to stop\n * the testcontainer after. It is therefore simplest to just launch the etcd\n * server before getting Pax Exam's world, like this does.\n *\n * @author Michael Vorburger.ch"
