    context: `You are analyzing the relationship between "${params.preferredTopic}" and a list of available topics.
For each topic, determine how closely it relates to "${params.preferredTopic}" on a scale of 0-1.
Consider semantic relationships, domain overlaps, and typical co-occurrence patterns.

Available topics to analyze:
${params.availableTopics.join(', ')}

Provide relevance scores where:
1.0 = Direct relationship/same domain (relationshipType: direct)
0.7-0.9 = Strong relationship/overlapping domain (relationshipType: strong)
0.4-0.6 = Moderate relationship/related domain (relationshipType: moderate)
0.1-0.3 = Weak relationship/tangentially related (relationshipType: weak)
0.0 = No meaningful relationship (relationshipType: none)

For each topic, also provide:
1. A brief explanation of the relationship
2. Specific examples of how the topics relate
3. Potential synergies or conflicts between the topics

Your analysis should consider:
- Semantic overlap
- Domain relationships
- Common use cases
- Typical co-occurrence in content
- Industry or field relationships
- Hierarchical relationships (if any)

Format the response as a JSON object with:
- relatedTopics: array of topic relationships
- analysisMetadata: containing confidence and timestamp`,
  };
