Generate player cards for the NHL AI agent.
Add Team logo and headshot image to card from the NHL API
Information: Name, Team, Position, Age, Height, Weight, Handedness, avg TOI, GP
Scoring Header: Goals, assists, points, primary points, primary assists, 5on5 Goals, 5on5 Points, 5on5 Primary Points
Underlying Numbers Even Strength Header: Query moneypuck database for 5 on 5 expected goals for on ice and percentile, and expected goals against on ice (5 on 5) and percentile, expected goals percentage, expected goals difference. 
Special Teams: Check for min toi for pp and pk, if not met, set to "NA". If met, query moneypuck database for expected goals for (pp) and against on ice (pk) and percentile, also list Powerplay goals, assists, and points.
Team Impact: On ice expected goals for per 60 when playing - same team same stat not on ice, same for defense, and finally for the difference. 

If Multiple seasons are selected, create a graph for xg % at 5 on 5 for each season. Do the above for all the seasons together.
