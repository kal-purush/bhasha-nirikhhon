        "\"Robin Norgren, M.A.Th, is a Creativity Facilitator and Business Coach living in King George, Virginia. She received her business coaching certification through Southwest Institute of Healing Arts and received a B.S. in Management from Arizona State University and a M.A. in Theology from Fuller Theological Seminary.\\r\\n\\r\\nJosey&#39;s Art School offers many types of creativity programs for kids and adults.  We bring all equipment and supplies to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Options include:\\r\\n\\r\\nArt Masterpiece Program - This program is organized in a similar fashion as Art Museum kid&#39;s classes where we offer a brief art history lesson and then create an art project focused on the artist we explore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Art and Literacy Project - This program introduces kids to fun stories and then invites them to explore the images or concepts within the book through an arts and crafts project.  This one is our most popular program having been utilized as curriculum at two Montessori schools in Arizona.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt Experiences: Mixed media Projects -This program offers a unique way of teaching art technique to children.  We work with all types of paint, watercolors, scrapbook paper and random items we use in our day to day lives.  This program is created by a Montessori trained teacher who recognizes and honors the various age groups in the classroom and modifies\\/amplifies the lesson based on skill level.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Like Me: Confidence Building Art - These projects are geared towards establishing art as a means to work through stress and anxiety and develop self esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWine and Paint\\/Art Workshops for Women - We offer a multitude of projects that you will not only love creating but will be proud to hang in your home or give as a gift.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also create Summer Camps, Workshops and Birthday party experiences\\r\\n\\r\\nComing Soon: Sewing workshops for kids\\r\\n\\r\\nI truly believe that art is a vital component in our lives, promoting peace joy and a sense of connectedness to ourselves and with each other. My work builds a foundation that helps children develop coping skills for stress and anxiety which they will draw from time and again throughout their lifetimes. We offer opportunities for adults to play as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur mission is to ignite creativity in children and adults.\\r\\n\\r\\n  **********************************************************************************************************\\r\\n\\r\\nWould you like to start a Business Teaching Art Classes to Kids?

Small commercial use is acceptable, if you are unsure if you are mass producing feel free to contact me. You are NEVER allowed to offer my designs on print on demand sites such as Zazzle, caf\\u00e9 press, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nNO you may not under any circumstances turn any embroidery design into an SVG or any other cutting file. \\r\\n\\r\\nNO you may not under any circumstances use any design or part of a design to create a new design you intend to sell. You may mash designs together, stitch it, and sell the finished item.\\r\\n \\r\\nYOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO SELL, SHARE, GIVE AWAY, OR TRADE MY DESIGNS\\r\\n\\r\\nEMBROIDERY:\\r\\nAll embroidery designs come with instant download and in the following formats. .pes, .xxx, .jef, .exp, .vip, .dst, .hus, .vp3\\r\\n \\r\\nYou must have a working knowledge of your embroidery machine and a means to transfer your design to your machine. I am not familiar with all embroidery machines or software, please refer to your user guide with questions about this.\\r\\n\\r\\nShop stock files: There will be no refunds due to the digital nature of these files however if you do have any issues please contact me with your concerns and I will work with you to resolve the issues. All of my files have been tested and approved prior to putting into the shop, it is recommended that you sample the file prior to final goods being embroidered.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nPLEASE NOTE:  \\r\\nSome embroidery designs come with multiple sizes and others only come with one size, it is your responsibility to read the design description and be aware of the size you are purchasing. I do NOT offer exchanges if you purchase the wrong size. The size is clearly listed in the title as well as the description. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPORTANT:\\r\\nDue to the large stitch counts with my designs you need to use the correct amount of stabilizer. Since each machine is different I can&#39;t tell you the best stabilizer to use for your particular machine. I prefer to use a good weight cutaway and float a piece of tearaway when necessary. Hooping not floating is highly recommended. My embroidery designs stitch best in the size they are created in. I am NOT responsible for the quality of the stitchout if you resize, alter, or convert it anyway. If you don&#39;t stabilize properly you won&#39;t have a good stitchout. \"",

Please select the desired quantity if multiple headbands are needed. Great for birthday parties and other events. \\n\\nOne size fits all: babies, children and adults. Headbands are very comfortable for all to wear! We often forget we even have them on! Most babies with little hair don&#39;t even notice them and can keep them on for long periods of time! These also expand for the adults at the party! \\n\\nThese usually ship extremely fast depending on the party date! I am happy to put these in the mail right away if your event is coming up fast. If you need these within 5 days, please select priority shipping or the option for me to create yours first and run it to the post office right away. Happy to accommodate any party date. I have had great luck with the mail getting to events on time, however I cannot guarantee with the postal service. International orders outside of the U.S. may take 1-4 weeks depending on location. \\n \\nIf you want multiple animal ear headbands from my shop, simply add the desired animals to your cart and the shipping will automatically adjust!

She made a special trip all the way from Africa, here to my home in Florida so that she could be glittered! \\n\\nShe would love to be an addition to your safari themed decor, wedding, shower or birthday party!\\n\\nGabby is a repurposed figurine that I meticulously hand glued and layered with thick coats of fine coarse green glitter.

You must make sure your address is correct at the time of purchase and use your own Etsy account - not a friend&#39;s when ordering.  If you wish to have an item shipped as a gift, you must enter the recipient&#39;s mailing address during the Checkout process.  Once you&#39;ve completed your purchase, your mailing address is fixed for that purchase, and even an address update AFTER you purchase, will not be reflected for the previous purchase.  It is the responsibility of the buyer to make sure all billing and shipping information is correct at the time of purchase.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can&#39;t stress this enough:  We can ONLY ship to addresses found on your order receipt and under NO circumstance, can we ship to ANY another address!\\r\\n\\r\\nUPCOMING HOLIDAYS & CLOSURES: \\r\\n\\u2022 Friday, June 17th - Father&#39;s Day Weekend - CLOSED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2022 Monday, July 4th - Independence Day - CLOSED\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note:  These holidays\\/closures do not count towards turnaround time.

Shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, and all international destinations are subject to additional shipping charges.  Please email for details before purchasing - Additional fees will apply.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTURNAROUND TIME FOR SHIPPED ITEMS:\\r\\nAll orders are filled in the order they are received.  During heavy order volume, all orders will take the maximum number of days to make. Please place your order as soon as possible to ensure faster delivery.  In a hurry?  Let us know as soon as possible, and we will make every effort to accommodate you.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCOMBINED SHIPPING:\\r\\nAll orders will be combined in as few shipments as possible at the full discretion of Boogie Bear Invitations.  Multiple orders will still be shipped within the stated turnaround time, but may ship together in one box with one tracking number. For example: You purchase one item in the morning, then later in the afternoon, purchase another item, then tomorrow, purchase another item, most likely (but not guaranteed) your items will all ship together - in 1 box with 1 transaction - within the stated turnaround time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, we may ship very large orders\\/items separately at our discretion to make sure everything fits in the box well - separate tracking numbers will be provided in this instance.  For orders that contain party invitations and party decor, we may elect to ship out your party invitations sooner to expedite.  Please request this specifically if you&#39;re under a time constraint, and we&#39;ll make every effort to accommodate you as our schedule allows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt&#39;s been our experience, that even when customers buy separate items with separate transactions, they desire their party items to be delivered in as few shipments as possible, and to avoid loss from the post office by having each item out separately.  Separate shipping charges will not be credited or refunded for any reason, due to separate transactions.  If you wish to consolidate shipping fees, you must purchase your party items together at the same time in one transaction and payment.  We appreciate your understanding.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPLEASE NOTE:\\r\\nA delay in providing party information in its entirety will delay the order overall and extend the turnaround time.  Turnaround time begins when ALL required information is received.    \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER IMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\\r\\nOnce the package ships, it is in the hands of the Post Office. We are not responsible and will not give refunds for packages that are lost\\/unclaimed\\/damaged\\/not delivered\\/not delivered on time or left out in the elements causing damage.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor a positive buying experience, please take the appropriate steps to ensure:\\r\\n1.  Your address is correct at the time of purchase\\r\\n2.  You are able to receive the item(s) you are buying - no restrictions to your address\\r\\n3.

We are not responsible and will not give refunds for &quot;Unclaimed&quot; packages or the customer&#39;s failure to be available for signature pickup if required.  A note left by the post office, qualifies as a delivery, and is a request for a prompt pickup from the post office.  It is the buyers sole responsibility to pick up the box in a timely manner.  If an &quot;unclaimed&quot; package is mailed back to us, we consider it a forfeit of product, will not re-ship the box or provide a refund.

Please contact us for information on receiving a printed proof.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665\\r\\n\\r\\nMADE IN THE USA!\\r\\nWe use only the highest quality products in all of our party items.  All of our products are proudly designed and made by hand in San Antonio, Texas from a growing number of material products manufactured in the United States.  We refuse to compromise on quality so whenever possible, we use material products made in the USA to support local businesses and jobs.  We are excited to announce that over 90% of all of our material products are proudly manufactured in the United States!  \\r\\n\\r\\nWE LOVE COLOR!\\r\\nWe currently have 62 colors of curling ribbon, and 98 colors of tulle - Wow!  We have an amazing (and large) card stock color selection as well.  What can we say?  We LOVE color!  We are working to expand our paper party straw colors - more exciting designs to come soon.  :)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665\\r\\n\\r\\nTURNAROUND TIME:\\r\\nTurnaround time is the amount of time it take to process your order and make your lovely party items - from order date to shipping date. All turnaround time is based on business days. Business days are from Monday-Friday, and exclude holidays. Holidays are disclosed in our &quot;Shipping Polices&quot; section. These holidays do not count toward turnaround time. All turnaround times are based on individual item sales. For large orders, or orders containing multiple party items, the turnaround time may be extended a bit.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAn example: A &quot;Happy 1st Birthday banner&quot; generally takes 3-5 business days to make.  For a purchase that that includes a Happy 1st Birthday Banner, Door Banner, Cupcake Toppers, and favor tags will usually take longer than 3-5 business days to make.  Generally party packages (multiple party items) take 1-2 weeks to make.  Please contact us if you plan on making multiple party items and are on a tight deadline.  We appreciate your understanding.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRUSH SERVICE:\\r\\nIn a hurry?  Need your party items faster than the stated turnaround time?  We may be able to help!  Rush Service is get your party items to you as fast as possible.  Rush does not mean that other customers wait, but is for us to work outside our normal business hours (evening, weekends, hire extra help) to finish your party items as fast as possible.  Rush is based on availability and is not automatically guaranteed to be available for all items at all times - and MUST be approved beforehand.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRush Service is between 25-100% of your total cost of items, depending on our availability and how fast you need your items.  Rush prices are set based on the current workload and expenses to fulfill the Custom Order.  In the event of a RUSH order, the customer is responsible for being available for pick-up. Please make sure your address is a good address, conducive to receiving boxes in a safe location.  A signature may be required for pick-up. \\r\\n\\r\\nNo refunds will be issued for &quot;Unclaimed&quot; packages or the failure to be available for signature pickup if required.  If an &quot;unclaimed&quot; package is mailed back to us, we will not re-ship the box or provide any refund.  By leaving the box &quot;unclaimed&quot; and forcing the post office to return to us, you are forfeiting your party items and the money paid for them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that we can only guarantee the &quot;Ship by&quot; date and shipping method and NOT the arrival date.  We don&#39;t anticipate any troubles, but just want you to be aware of our policy on shipped items.  Additional shipping fees may also apply.  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions?  Please fee free to ask about this popular RUSH service upgrade.  \\r\\n \\r\\n\\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665\\r\\n\\r\\nCAUTION:\\r\\nUse caution and your very best discretion when using any of our products around babies and small children.  Do not let any small child be unattended with any of our products, as items may present a choking hazard.  Keep all products away from heat or open flame.  Products are made of paper, and are flammable if exposed to heat or open flame.  Buyer assumes ALL liability and responsibility for product discretion.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll party items are intended for single use only for a single event.  It may be possible to use a product for more than one event if special loving care is given, but there should be no expectation of repeated use.  All items should be used for the purpose intended and special care should be used when storing\\/displaying your party items.  Misuse of any of our products may damage them and render them unusable for your event.  An Example: You purchase a paper party banner, but leave the banner outside exposed to the elements for an extended period of time, and your banner paper edges curl under due to humidity, the banner gets wet from rain, or prolonged sun exposure has damaged the banner.  These are just a few examples of misuse that shortens and compromises the integrity of the party product.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce your order arrives at your address, quickly bring the package inside and store safely in a cool dry place away from sun, rain, open flame, extreme heat\\/cold, or any other factor that can damage the party items.  We are not liable for items improperly used or stored - We appreciate your understanding!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665\\r\\n\\r\\nPROOFS:\\r\\nLow resolution draft proofs available for invitations and announcements.  2 draft proofs are included with changes permitted.  Any additional changes with another proof request will incur a $6.00 charge for and additional round of 2 proofs.  When you receive your proof, please review it carefully for errors.  Please remember that there is only so much room for text on an invitation\\/announcement.  Any additional text requested that is not part of the original invitation\\/announcement design (such as adding a paragraph to the back of an invitation) is considered custom, and additional charges will apply.\\r\\n\\r\\n Please note: It&#39;s imperative that you are available for Etsy email correspondence during the proofing process, as we are unable to keep orders &quot;open&quot; past the &quot;ship by&quot; date (found on your order receipt).  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are not responsible for orders with incorrect information or typos due to customer error. Additionally, we are not responsible for orders with typos that were viewed and approved by the customer during proofing - this includes spelling and punctuation.  Request all changes at one time to preserve your allowed proofs.  Once the proof has been approved, it considered FINAL.  Please contact us if you have approved a final proof, and need another change.  Additional charges will apply.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665\\r\\n\\r\\nPAPERLESS PRINTABLE ITEMS:\\r\\nWe offer paperless printable items for invitations and announcements ONLY.  All other party items in our party shop come fully printed and assembled for your special day.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaperless printable items do not include envelopes. Please note: The paperless printable option comes with the front side of the invitation\\/announcement only.  We are prohibited by law from providing the back in &quot;printable&quot; form, as the graphics can be easily &quot;extracted&quot; (stolen).  For a double sided product, please purchase the &quot;printed&quot; option in the drop-down menu. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe &quot;paperless printable&quot; option comes with 1 format only - PDF or JPEG format - you choose 1.  Once you select your final file type (PDF or JPEG) and your final file format is emailed to you, this will complete your order with us.  Any requests for an additional format - for any reason - will incur an additional fee.  \\r\\n\\r\\nVery Important:\\r\\nYour purchase price of a &quot;paperless printable&quot; includes 1 format only - you choose PDF or JPEG.  If you make a mistake, and need another format after we&#39;ve provided your final file type, it&#39;s no problem, but will incur an extra charge for this extra format.  No other file format types available - PDF or JPEG only.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you plan on purchasing a paperless printable to have it printed by a third party (including yourself), you are solely responsible for making sure that the format (JPEG or PDF) and sizing meets your third party requirements.  If you need any bleed\\/trim marks, sizing, color change, or any other printing changes, this is a premium service and additional charges will apply.  The paperless printable option is a service offered for those who are familiar with the formats offered, and can open, support, and print these formats.  Please ask your third party service if they can accept the sizing and file types available prior to purchasing.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe require the party information to be provided within 3 business days of placing your order, AND timely email responses for the proofing process.  If you need more time, it&#39;s no trouble at all, but we need to receive at least one correspondence from you letting us know the situation within 2 business days.  If we have not heard from you at all (and no party information was provided at checkout) we will refund the purchase price minus a $10.00 non-refundable administrative fee.  If the administrative fee of $10.00 exceeds the original purchase price, then no refund will be given.  If you&#39;ve provided the party information at checkout, but then not responded to our email proof conversation via Etsy email within 3 business days, we will send another email attempting to make contact.  If we still have not received any response within 24 hours of that email, then we will send your final image to you - &quot;as is&quot; JPEG file with no watermark - which will complete your order with us.   We appreciate your understanding as we are unable to keep orders &quot;open&quot; past the &quot;Ship-by&quot; date (found on your order receipt).  \\r\\n\\r\\nPDF FILES:\\r\\nIf you select PDF as your final format, you must open and print the document using Adobe Acrobat Reader (free version) or Adobe Acrobat Pro ONLY - Your PDF document is not permitted to open with Photoshop, Illustrator, or any other program that supports editing capabilities.  Your PDF file will be flattened and no layers or editing is permitted.  We do not provide any technical support for opening or printing the document.  The buyer is solely responsible for making sure they have the proper program (free version available online) for opening and printing any PDF file purchased from Boogie Bear Invitations, as well as the knowledge for printing a PDF file.  No modifications are permitted with the PDF file - It&#39;s open and print only.  We appreciate your understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do NOT sell blank or un-personalized &quot;Paperless Printable&quot; items.  If you wish to have a generic statement, such as &quot;Thank You&quot; (with no other text) you must purchase the printed version.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBoogie Bear Invitations offers printing services, and is NOT responsible for second and third party printing problems with alignment, spacing, color, format, computer program support, or any other issues regarding printing from second and third parties.   Troubleshoot margin and color problems on your computer and printer to achieve the appropriate final product.   \\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665 \\u2665\\r\\n\\r\\nCUSTOM ORDERS:\\r\\nNeed something special?  We love custom orders!  Please send us an email with your vision, products desired, along with your party date to see if we can meet your needs by your deadline.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll Custom Order details must be decided upon prior to us setting up your Custom Order.  An Example: You&#39;d like a special custom party invitation made for your honoree&#39;s birthday, but don&#39;t have the location information decided yet.  We will need all information decided and ready to be provided before we set up your custom order - this includes any photos if applicable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll orders are filled in the order received, so early ordering ensures faster delivery.  Once we&#39;ve set up your Custom Order, it will be good for 48 hours from the date set up.  This policy ensures that your Custom Order can be fulfilled in the specified turnaround time, and that we are able to complete your order.  If you have missed your 48 hour window, please contact us to see if we are able to complete your custom order by your deadline.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrice quotes are only good for the day quoted only, unless otherwise stated, which ensures availability and the &quot;ship by&quot; date.  Once the day has passed, you&#39;ll need to contact us for a new price quote - additional fees may apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll payment is required upfront before any work is to be done.  Due to the nature of our handmade custom items, no refunds are given once payment has been received.  Custom orders take time, finesse, materials, and creative energy.  We appreciate your understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note, that in the event of a Custom Order:\\r\\n\\u2022 You are asking us to make something special and unique, just for you.  We will do our best to listen to your vision, and provide timely feedback throughout the process, as well as provide detailed information on what is expected - both options and restraints.  That being said, there is a small, teeny, tiny chance that you may not fall in love with our final product.  Please note that that you are paying for our time and we will work very hard to get you what you&#39;re looking for, but alas, not all can be pleased.  There are no refunds on Custom Orders due to the nature of the product.  If you are at all uneasy about the process, or just very nervous about the outcome, we encourage you to trust your instinct.    \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note, that in the event of a Custom Order:\\r\\n\\u2022 We are creating something new, that not currently available in our shop.  This may include new colors, new graphics, or a brand new party theme altogether.  Although we are creating a new party item for you, we may decide to sell this same new party item at some point in the future (no personal info will be used).  Please don&#39;t feel cheated - it&#39;s actually a compliment!  It means that we loved your vision so much, and were so pleased with the final products we&#39;ve made for you, that we&#39;ve decided to make it a permanent party theme - the crowning achievement at Boogie Bear Invitations - complete with it&#39;s official &quot;Naming&quot; of the party theme.  :)\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Information:\\r\\nWe do not accept any custom work for copyrighted material.

You may choose eye and hair color, model and make, weight and I can even add a cute little belly and bum plate for a completed look. \\n\\nI take great pride in the many hours I spend creating life-like skin tones, micro-rooted hair, painted hair or a combination and an overall realistic reborn from a smoke-free, pet free home.\\n\\nI also offer something I haven&#39;t seen from anyone else! If you have locks from your babies first hair cut, or any that you&#39;d like me to root your sweetheart with, I&#39;d love to make your reborn that much more special. It works best if locks are at least 1.5&quot; or longer.\\n\\nIf you choose a model that&#39;s on sale, I can make your little sweetheart for just $299. The more you want (belly, back plates, heart beat, recorder, binky, bottle, umbilical stump ...) the more it&#39;ll be. \\n\\nYour deposit will be used as part of the total, but once I have ordered everything I need , your deposit is non-refundable.\\n\\nI will keep in touch and even send pictures of my progress if you&#39;d like, to assure my image is yours. \\n\\nPlease note that the babies pictured are examples of custom orders I&#39;ve created in the past, but I can create look a likes.\\nIf you have any questions, I would love to answer them. Thanks so much for considering me :)\"",

        "\"I&#39;m Arlene and I would love to make your vision come to life! You may choose eye and hair color, model and make, weight and I can even add a cute little belly and bum plate or torso for a completed look. \\n\\nI take great pride in the many hours I spend creating life-like skin tones, micro-rooted hair, painted hair or a combination and an overall realistic reborn from a smoke-free home.\\n\\nI also offer something I haven&#39;t seen from anyone else! If you have locks from your babies first hair cut, or any that you&#39;d like me to root your sweetheart with, I&#39;d love to make your reborn that much more special. It works best if locks are at least 1.5&quot; or longer.\\n\\nIf you choose a model that&#39;s on sale, I can make your little sweetheart for just $289. The more you want (belly, back plates, heart beat, recorder, binky, bottle, umbilical stump, open mouth ...) the more it&#39;ll be. \\n\\nYour deposit will be used as part of the total, but once I have ordered everything I need , your deposit is non-refundable.\\n\\nI will keep in touch and even send pictures of my progress if you&#39;d like, to assure my image is yours. \\n\\nPlease note that the babies pictured are examples of custom orders I&#39;ve created in the past, but I can create look a likes.\\nIf you have any questions, I would love to answer them. Thanks so much for considering me :)\"",

He&#39;s done all in single crochet and stands almost 10&quot; tall by 7&quot; wide at the bottom.  He&#39;s leaning forward on his knuckles as gorillas do and he has a pudgy little belly and a little bit of rust-colored hair on top of his head like the Silverback gorillas do.  But since he&#39;s so young, he still doesn&#39;t have the silver down his back.  Note his muscular arms and little thumbs. \\nThis pattern can be downloaded instantly from Etsy when Paypal payment is complete. \\n\\n  The pattern has photos to help along the way and if you have any questions about the instructions, you can email me directly or contact me through Etsy convo.  I will be glad to help you.\\n\\nThank you for visiting my store!\"",

My customers have been wonderful and have paid me the nicest compliments.  It gives me the incentive to keep designing.\\r\\n          I design all my own patterns, some of which I research actual baby animal photos for inspiration.  I strive to make each character have a sweet, innocent personality and sometimes do the faces over and over again until I achieve that.  My patterns all have photos to help with the instructions and are usually emailed via PDF format the same day as ordered.  I am starting to convert some of my patterns to instant download so that you may have them quicker.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**I have lots of loyal customers who have purchased many of my characters, so after ordering 10 patterns, I will send the next one free.  Just send me an email requesting which one you would like when you order your 10th pattern.**\\r\\n\\r\\nAll patterns offered at bvoe668.Etsy.Com are protected by international copyright laws and are intended for PERSONAL USE only.

I have used super glue in some of my experimentation charms, and it holds well. If an item is shipped and you find this happens, please let me know and I will send you another one. If you happen to break one of your charms, please send me an email and I can send you another charm for a fee + shipping. \\r\\n3) Because I hand draw and shade each charm, please know that not all charms will look exactly the same- this adds to their uniqueness and should not be considered a flaw. \\r\\n4) All designs are original- I hold all rights to designs and photos taken of my jewelry- please respect this.
