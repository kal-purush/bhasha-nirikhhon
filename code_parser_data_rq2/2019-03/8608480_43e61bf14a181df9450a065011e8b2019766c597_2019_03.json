        "* The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for\n   * different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is\n   * used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n   * - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet\n   * unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of\n   * data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should\n   * be an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error\n   * codes if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English\n   * message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a\n   * localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in\n   * the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details\n   * may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined\n   * set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for\n   * common error conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the\n   * logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the\n   * actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different\n   * client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped\n   * differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in\n   * Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The\n   * error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\n   * environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent\n   * developer experience across different environments.  Example uses of this\n   * error model include:  - Partial errors. If a service needs to return\n   * partial errors to the client,     it may embed the `Status` in the normal\n   * response to indicate the partial     errors.  - Workflow errors. A typical\n   * workflow has multiple steps. Each step may     have a `Status` message for\n   * error reporting.  - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and\n   * batch response, the     `Status` message should be used directly inside\n   * batch response, one for     each error sub-response.  - Asynchronous\n   * operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation     results in its\n   * response, the status of those operations should be     represented directly\n   * using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some API errors are stored in\n   * logs, the message `Status` could     be used directly after any stripping\n   * needed for security/privacy reasons.",
