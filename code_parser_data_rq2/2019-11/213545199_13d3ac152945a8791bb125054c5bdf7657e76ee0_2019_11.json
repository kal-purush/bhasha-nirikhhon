        "YOUR 3 CHALLENGES\nChange the game to follow these rules:\n\n1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. \nAfter that, it's the next player's turn. (Hint: Always save the previous \n    dice roll in a separate variable)\n2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score,\n so that they can change the predefined score of 100. (Hint: you can \n    read that value with the .value property in JavaScript. This is a \n    good oportunity to use google to figure this out :)\n3. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The \nplayer looses his current score when one of them is a 1. (Hint: you will \n    need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS code \n    for the first one.)",
