        "\"\"\"\nNumPy Array API compatibility library\n\nThis is a small wrapper around NumPy, CuPy, JAX, sparse and others that are\ncompatible with the Array API standard https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/.\nSee also NEP 47 https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0047-array-api-standard.html.\n\nUnlike array_api_strict, this is not a strict minimal implementation of the\nArray API, but rather just an extension of the main NumPy namespace with\nchanges needed to be compliant with the Array API. See\nhttps://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/array_api.html for a full list of\nchanges. In particular, unlike array_api_strict, this package does not use a\nseparate Array object, but rather just uses numpy.ndarray directly.\n\nLibrary authors using the Array API may wish to test against array_api_strict\nto ensure they are not using functionality outside of the standard, but prefer\nthis implementation for the default when working with NumPy arrays.\n\n\"\"\""
