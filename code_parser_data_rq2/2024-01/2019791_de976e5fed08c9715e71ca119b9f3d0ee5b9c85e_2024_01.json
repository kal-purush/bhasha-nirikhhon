When the command finishes executing, these keys must be set back to an empty string so that incorrect\n     * values do not persist outside of command execution (like would occur during flow). {@link MdcKey#LIQUIBASE_SYSTEM_USER}\n     * is purposefully excluded from this method because it does not need to be reset when command execution finishes\n     * because it should be constant throughout the entire Liquibase execution."
