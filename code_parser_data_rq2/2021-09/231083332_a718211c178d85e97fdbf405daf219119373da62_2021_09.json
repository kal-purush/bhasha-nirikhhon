        "* Class that wraps EnumeratedDistribution for thread safe use in Synthea. In several places in\n * Synthea, EnumeratedDistributions are used following a\n * <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern>singleton pattern</a>. One distribution\n * is used in a particular aspect of simulation. To support reproducibility of simulations, its\n * source of randomness is reseeded for each individual. Since multiple threads may be accessing\n * the distribution at the same time, it would be possible to reseed the distribution in one thread\n * but sample on that seed in another thread. This class offers a synchronized method to prevent\n * that with the handy side benefit that it takes the well-known and loved Synthea Person as a\n * source of randomness.\n * @param <T> The type to be returned when sampling from the distribiution.",
        "* Just calls super. Look at the docs for EnumeratedDistributed for more details.\n   * @param pmf List of pairs of values and their weight in the distribution.",
        "* Sample from the distribution after it has been reseeded using the Person provided as a source\n   * of randomness.\n   * @param person Where the randomness comes from\n   * @return a value from the distribution based on a weighted, random selection"
