        "* An instance of {@link DataSystem} is a \"read-only object datastore and query engine\". It is a specific data system\n * limited to the goals of this project. Basically, it lets you query table-like data with a primitive query API.\n * <p>\n * Specific implementations of {@link DataSystem} offer a way to load data into the system but that varies for different\n * providers. For a SQL-based system, for example, the write/load interface would be JDBC.",
        "* Execute the given query and return a list of matching records.\n     * <p>\n     * The result set is a pruned table. Consider a table that represents a city. It has two columns: \"city_name\" and\n     * \"state code\". Return a new table where its component columns are pruned down to the rows that\n     * matched the criteria."
