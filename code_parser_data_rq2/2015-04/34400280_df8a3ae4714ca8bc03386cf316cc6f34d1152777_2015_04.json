Atom commands are expressed\n     * as custom DOM events that can be invoked on the currently focused element via\n     * a key binding or manually via the command palette. Rather than binding\n     * listeners for command events directly to DOM nodes, you instead register\n     * command event listeners globally on `atom.commands` and constrain them to\n     * specific kinds of elements with CSS selectors.\n     * \n     * As the event bubbles upward through the DOM, all registered event listeners\n     * with matching selectors are invoked in order of specificity. In the event of a\n     * specificity tie, the most recently registered listener is invoked first. This\n     * mirrors the \"cascade\" semantics of CSS.

For example we might an integer setting that only\n     * allows integers greater than `0`:\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * # When no value has been set, `::get` returns the setting's default value\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.anInt') # -> 12\n     * \n     * # The string will be coerced to the integer 123\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.anInt', '123')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.anInt') # -> 123\n     * \n     * # The string will be coerced to an integer, but it must be greater than 0, so is set to 1\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.anInt', '-20')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.anInt') # -> 1\n     * ```\n     * \n     * ## Defining settings for your package\n     * \n     * Define a schema under a `config` key in your package main.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * module.exports =\n     *   # Your config schema\n     *   config:\n     *     someInt:\n     *       type: 'integer'\n     *       default: 23\n     *       minimum: 1\n     * \n     *   activate: (state) -> # ...\n     *   # ...\n     * ```\n     * \n     * See [package docs](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-package-word-count) for\n     * more info.\n     * \n     * ## Config Schemas\n     * \n     * We use [json schema](http://json-schema.org) which allows you to define your value's\n     * default, the type it should be, etc. A simple example:\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * # We want to provide an `enableThing`, and a `thingVolume`\n     * config:\n     *   enableThing:\n     *     type: 'boolean'\n     *     default: false\n     *   thingVolume:\n     *     type: 'integer'\n     *     default: 5\n     *     minimum: 1\n     *     maximum: 11\n     * ```\n     * \n     * The type keyword allows for type coercion and validation. If a `thingVolume` is\n     * set to a string `'10'`, it will be coerced into an integer.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.thingVolume', '10')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.thingVolume') # -> 10\n     * \n     * # It respects the min / max\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.thingVolume', '400')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.thingVolume') # -> 11\n     * \n     * # If it cannot be coerced, the value will not be set\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.thingVolume', 'cats')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.thingVolume') # -> 11\n     * ```\n     * \n     * ### Supported Types\n     * \n     * The `type` keyword can be a string with any one of the following. You can also\n     * chain them by specifying multiple in an an array. For example\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: ['boolean', 'integer']\n     *     default: 5\n     * \n     * # Then\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', 'true')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> true\n     * \n     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '12')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 12\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### string\n     * \n     * Values must be a string.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: 'string'\n     *     default: 'hello'\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### integer\n     * \n     * Values will be coerced into integer. Supports the (optional) `minimum` and\n     * `maximum` keys.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     *   config:\n     *     someSetting:\n     *       type: 'integer'\n     *       default: 5\n     *       minimum: 1\n     *       maximum: 11\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### number\n     * \n     * Values will be coerced into a number, including real numbers. Supports the\n     * (optional) `minimum` and `maximum` keys.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: 'number'\n     *     default: 5.3\n     *     minimum: 1.5\n     *     maximum: 11.5\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### boolean\n     * \n     * Values will be coerced into a Boolean. `'true'` and `'false'` will be coerced into\n     * a boolean. Numbers, arrays, objects, and anything else will not be coerced.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: 'boolean'\n     *     default: false\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### array\n     * \n     * Value must be an Array. The types of the values can be specified by a\n     * subschema in the `items` key.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: 'array'\n     *     default: [1, 2, 3]\n     *     items:\n     *       type: 'integer'\n     *       minimum: 1.5\n     *       maximum: 11.5\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### object\n     * \n     * Value must be an object. This allows you to nest config options. Sub options\n     * must be under a `properties key`\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: 'object'\n     *     properties:\n     *       myChildIntOption:\n     *         type: 'integer'\n     *         minimum: 1.5\n     *         maximum: 11.5\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### color\n     * \n     * Values will be coerced into a {Color} with `red`, `green`, `blue`, and `alpha`\n     * properties that all have numeric values. `red`, `green`, `blue` will be in\n     * the range 0 to 255 and `value` will be in the range 0 to 1. Values can be any\n     * valid CSS color format such as `#abc`, `#abcdef`, `white`,\n     * `rgb(50, 100, 150)`, and `rgba(25, 75, 125, .75)`.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: 'color'\n     *     default: 'white'\n     * ```\n     * \n     * ### Other Supported Keys\n     * \n     * #### enum\n     * \n     * All types support an `enum` key. The enum key lets you specify all values\n     * that the config setting can possibly be. `enum` _must_ be an array of values\n     * of your specified type. Schema:\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     type: 'integer'\n     *     default: 4\n     *     enum: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n     * ```\n     * \n     * Usage:\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '2')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 2\n     * \n     * # will not set values outside of the enum values\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '3')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 2\n     * \n     * # If it cannot be coerced, the value will not be set\n     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '4')\n     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 4\n     * ```\n     * \n     * #### title and description\n     * \n     * The settings view will use the `title` and `description` keys to display your\n     * config setting in a readable way. By default the settings view humanizes your\n     * config key, so `someSetting` becomes `Some Setting`. In some cases, this is\n     * confusing for users, and a more descriptive title is useful.\n     * \n     * Descriptions will be displayed below the title in the settings view.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * config:\n     *   someSetting:\n     *     title: 'Setting Magnitude'\n     *     description: 'This will affect the blah and the other blah'\n     *     type: 'integer'\n     *     default: 4\n     * ```\n     * \n     * __Note__: You should strive to be so clear in your naming of the setting that\n     * you do not need to specify a title or description!\n     * \n     * ## Best practices\n     * \n     * * Don't depend on (or write to) configuration keys outside of your keypath.\n     *\n     * file: src/config.coffee\n     * srcUrl: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v0.193.0/src/config.coffee#L291",

It looks for key bindings associated with selectors that match\n     * the target element. If multiple match, the most specific is selected. If there\n     * is a tie in specificity, the most recently added binding wins. If no bindings\n     * are found for the events target, the search is repeated again for the target's\n     * parent node and so on recursively until a binding is found or we traverse off\n     * the top of the document.\n     * \n     * When a binding is found, its command event is always dispatched on the\n     * original target of the keyboard event, even if the matching element is higher\n     * up in the DOM.

If `snippets:expand` is invoked when\n     * the cursor does not follow a valid snippet prefix, we abort the binding and\n     * allow `tab` to be handled by the default handler, which inserts whitespace.\n     * \n     * Multi-keystroke bindings are possible. If a sequence of one or more keystrokes\n     * *partially* matches a multi-keystroke binding, the keymap enters a pending\n     * state. The pending state is terminated on the next keystroke, or after\n     * {::partialMatchTimeout} milliseconds has elapsed. When the pending state is\n     * terminated via a timeout or a keystroke that leads to no matches, the longest\n     * ambiguous bindings that caused the pending state are temporarily disabled and\n     * the previous keystrokes are replayed. If there is ambiguity again during the\n     * replay, the next longest bindings are disabled and the keystrokes are replayed\n     * again. \n     *\n     * file: src/keymap-manager.coffee\n     * srcUrl: https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/blob/v5.1.2/src/keymap-manager.coffee#L67",

If you think of a\n     * marker as an editor selection, the tail is the part that's stationary and the\n     * head is the part that moves when the mouse is moved. A marker without a tail\n     * always reports an empty range at the head position. A marker with a head position\n     * greater than the tail is in a \"normal\" orientation. If the head precedes the\n     * tail the marker is in a \"reversed\" orientation.\n     * \n     * ### Validity\n     * \n     * Markers are considered *valid* when they are first created. Depending on the\n     * invalidation strategy you choose, certain changes to the buffer can cause a\n     * marker to become invalid, for example if the text surrounding the marker is\n     * deleted. The strategies, in order of descending fragility:\n     * \n     * * __never__: The marker is never marked as invalid. This is a good choice for\n     *   markers representing selections in an editor.\n     * * __surround__: The marker is invalidated by changes that completely surround it.\n     * * __overlap__: The marker is invalidated by changes that surround the\n     *   start or end of the marker. This is the default.\n     * * __inside__: The marker is invalidated by changes that extend into the\n     *   inside of the marker. Changes that end at the marker's start or\n     *   start at the marker's end do not invalidate the marker.\n     * * __touch__: The marker is invalidated by a change that touches the marked\n     *   region in any way, including changes that end at the marker's\n     *   start or start at the marker's end. This is the most fragile strategy.\n     * \n     * See {TextEditor::markBufferRange} for usage. \n     *\n     * file: src/marker.coffee\n     * srcUrl: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v0.193.0/src/marker.coffee#L44",

        "* This class represents all essential editing state for a single\n     * {TextBuffer}, including cursor and selection positions, folds, and soft wraps.\n     * If you're manipulating the state of an editor, use this class. If you're\n     * interested in the visual appearance of editors, use {TextEditorView} instead.\n     * \n     * A single {TextBuffer} can belong to multiple editors. For example, if the\n     * same file is open in two different panes, Atom creates a separate editor for\n     * each pane. If the buffer is manipulated the changes are reflected in both\n     * editors, but each maintains its own cursor position, folded lines, etc.\n     * \n     * ## Accessing TextEditor Instances\n     * \n     * The easiest way to get hold of `TextEditor` objects is by registering a callback\n     * with `::observeTextEditors` on the `atom.workspace` global. Your callback will\n     * then be called with all current editor instances and also when any editor is\n     * created in the future.\n     * \n     * ```coffee\n     * atom.workspace.observeTextEditors (editor) ->\n     *   editor.insertText('Hello World')\n     * ```\n     * \n     * ## Buffer vs. Screen Coordinates\n     * \n     * Because editors support folds and soft-wrapping, the lines on screen don't\n     * always match the lines in the buffer. For example, a long line that soft wraps\n     * twice renders as three lines on screen, but only represents one line in the\n     * buffer. Similarly, if rows 5-10 are folded, then row 6 on screen corresponds\n     * to row 11 in the buffer.\n     * \n     * Your choice of coordinates systems will depend on what you're trying to\n     * achieve. For example, if you're writing a command that jumps the cursor up or\n     * down by 10 lines, you'll want to use screen coordinates because the user\n     * probably wants to skip lines *on screen*. However, if you're writing a package\n     * that jumps between method definitions, you'll want to work in buffer\n     * coordinates.\n     * \n     * **When in doubt, just default to buffer coordinates**, then experiment with\n     * soft wraps and folds to ensure your code interacts with them correctly. \n     *\n     * file: src/text-editor.coffee\n     * srcUrl: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v0.193.0/src/text-editor.coffee#L56",
