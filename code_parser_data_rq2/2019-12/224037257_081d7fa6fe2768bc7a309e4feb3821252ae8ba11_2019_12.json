        "* ProgressItem is meant to mimic the the progress you can display using\n * `workspace.createStatusBarItem(0, { progress: true})`. Since we can't\n * guarauntee a user has a statusline integration, it won't do a lot of \n * good to display longer processes there. This will ensure that the user\n * can still see it is a longer running process as a workspace messages.\n * Later on, logic can be build in to handle the case where a user may\n * have a statusline and would like to have this displayed there along\n * with other long lived processes."
