Note that\nbefore a feature was introduced, the corresponding attribute is undefined.\n\nThe attributes listed here do not allow *controlling* whether a feature is\nactive or not; they only *indicate* whether the feature is supported and\nactive.\n\nNote: For tooling reasons, these attributes are shown as\n``pywbem._features.XXX``, but they should be used as ``pywbem.XXX``.\n\"\"\""
