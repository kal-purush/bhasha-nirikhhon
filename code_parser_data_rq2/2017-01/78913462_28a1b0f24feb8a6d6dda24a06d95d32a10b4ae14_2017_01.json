        "'''\nYou are given an integer N. Print the factorial of this number.\n\nInput \nInput consists of a single integer N, where  1 <= N < 100.\n\nOutput \nPrint the factorial of N .\n\nExample \nFor an input of 25, you would print 15511210043330985984000000.\n\nNote: Factorials of  can't be stored even in a  long long variable. \nBig integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. \ncan handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to \nhandle huge values.\n\nWe recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.\n\n'''"
