        "* Service Description: IAM Policy Troubleshooter service.\n *\n * <p>This service helps you troubleshoot access issues for Google Cloud resources.\n *\n * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method\n * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:\n *\n * <pre>{@code\n * try (IamCheckerClient iamCheckerClient = IamCheckerClient.create()) {\n *   TroubleshootIamPolicyRequest request = TroubleshootIamPolicyRequest.newBuilder().build();\n *   TroubleshootIamPolicyResponse response = iamCheckerClient.troubleshootIamPolicy(request);\n * }\n * }</pre>\n *\n * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the IamCheckerClient object to clean up resources such as\n * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().\n *\n * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's\n * methods:\n *\n * <ol>\n *   <li>A \"flattened\" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been\n *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as\n *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.\n *   <li>A \"request object\" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,\n *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object\n *       method.\n *   <li>A \"callable\" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API\n *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.\n * </ol>\n *\n * <p>See the individual methods for example code.\n *\n * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with\n * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse\n * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.\n *\n * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of IamCheckerSettings to\n * create(). For example:\n *\n * <p>To customize credentials:\n *\n * <pre>{@code\n * IamCheckerSettings iamCheckerSettings =\n *     IamCheckerSettings.newBuilder()\n *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))\n *         .build();\n * IamCheckerClient iamCheckerClient = IamCheckerClient.create(iamCheckerSettings);\n * }</pre>\n *\n * <p>To customize the endpoint:\n *\n * <pre>{@code\n * IamCheckerSettings iamCheckerSettings =\n *     IamCheckerSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();\n * IamCheckerClient iamCheckerClient = IamCheckerClient.create(iamCheckerSettings);\n * }</pre>\n *\n * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.",
