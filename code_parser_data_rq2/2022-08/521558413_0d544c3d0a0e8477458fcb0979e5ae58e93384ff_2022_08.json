(The repo that under A's name.)\n- Student A implements the `toss_coin()` function, and commits to the main branch.\n(Note: A and B are working on different repositories. A commits to A's forked main.)\n- Student A send a pull request and merge the code.\n\nYou may delete your repo after all tasks have completed.\n\n\nQuestions:\n1. In a scenario, where you work with others as a team. You wrote some code\nusing the lab machine, but the code isn't working. You decide to continue\nworking on the code from home. What's the best way to commit your unfinished code\nto GitHub without interrupt others? What commands do you need to achieve that?\n\n2. Explain the difference between merge and fork. Give an example for each use\ncase.\n\nAuthor: Luke Change (xcha011@aucklanduni.ac.nz)\nDate: 23/07/2022\n\"\"\"",
