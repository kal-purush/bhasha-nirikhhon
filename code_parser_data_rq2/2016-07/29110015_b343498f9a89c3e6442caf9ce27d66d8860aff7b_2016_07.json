The underlying PRNG is exposed as\n    `fn.rnd`, so `fn.rnd.reset` may be used to start over.\n    \n    **Use Case Example**: The below code demonstrates the interesting properties of the method returned by\n    `get_create_rnd_id`: **(1)** we can seed the PRNG with numbers of our choice, so we get a chance to create\n    IDs that are unlikely to be repeated by other people using the same software, even when later inputs (such\n    as the email adresses shown here) happen to be the same. **(2)** Calling the ID generator with three\n    diffferent user-specific inputs, we get three different IDs, as expected. **(3)** Repeating the ID\n    generation calls with the *same* arguments will yield *different* IDs. **(4)** After calling\n    `create_rnd_id.rnd.reset()` and feeding `create_rnd_id` with the *same* user-specific inputs, we can still\n    see the identical *same* IDs generated—which is great for testing.\n    \n        create_rnd_id = CND.get_create_rnd_id 1234, 87.23\n    \n         * three different user IDs:\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'foo@example.com' ], 12\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'alice@nosuchname.com' ], 12\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'tim@cern.ch' ], 12\n    \n         * the same repeated, but yielding random other IDs:\n        log()\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'foo@example.com' ], 12\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'alice@nosuchname.com' ], 12\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'tim@cern.ch' ], 12\n    \n         * the same repeated, but yielding the same IDs as in the first run:\n        log()\n        create_rnd_id.rnd.reset()\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'foo@example.com' ], 12\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'alice@nosuchname.com' ], 12\n        log create_rnd_id [ 'tim@cern.ch' ], 12\n    \n    The output you should see is\n    \n        c40f774fce65\n        9d44f31f9a55\n        1b26e6e3e736\n    \n        a0e11f616685\n        d7242f6935c7\n        976f26d1b25b\n    \n        c40f774fce65\n        9d44f31f9a55\n        1b26e6e3e736\n    \n    Note the last three IDs exactly match the first three IDs. The upshot of this is that we get reasonably\n    hard-to-guess, yet on-demand replayable IDs. Apart from weaknesses in the PRNG itself (for which see the\n    caveats in the description to `get_rnd`), the obvious way to cheat the system is by making it so that\n    a given piece of case-specific data is fed into the ID generator as the n-th call a second time. In\n    theory, we could make it so that each call constributes to the state change inside of `create_rnd_id`;\n    a replay would then need to provide all of the case-specific pieces of data a second time, in the right\n    order.",
