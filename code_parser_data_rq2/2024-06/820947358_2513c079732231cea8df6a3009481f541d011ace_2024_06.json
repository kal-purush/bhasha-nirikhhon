You can add in your own code to implement the capabilities\n      listed below, or change anything else you would like.\n\n\n      Need an introduction to Service Workers? Check our docs here: https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/sw-intro\n      Want to learn more about how our Service Worker generation works? Check our docs here: https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/studio/existing-app?id=add-a-service-worker\n\n      Did you know that Service Workers offer many more capabilities than just offline? \n        - Background Sync: https://microsoft.github.io/win-student-devs/#/30DaysOfPWA/advanced-capabilities/06\n        - Periodic Background Sync: https://web.dev/periodic-background-sync/\n        - Push Notifications: https://microsoft.github.io/win-student-devs/#/30DaysOfPWA/advanced-capabilities/07?id=push-notifications-on-the-web\n        - Badges: https://microsoft.github.io/win-student-devs/#/30DaysOfPWA/advanced-capabilities/07?id=application-badges",
